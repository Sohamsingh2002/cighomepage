I got a chance to work with the IIT Roorkee administration - particularly SRIC office. I had the pleasure to meet and work with some really great self-motivated people who formed the CIG team.",

      "My journey from a volunteer to the chairperson of the group started when I worked as a volunteer for my first event “Big boom” on the campus. After that, I officially joined this group as a designer. I think not only our CIG group but any group in IITR is not just a group it’s a family and CIG was that family who helped me to overcome my own insecurity, anxiety, and fear. CIG gave me an opportunity to prove myself.",
